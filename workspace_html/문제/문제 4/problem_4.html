            <div class="subtitle_3">Dave, the Streatham rapper who at just 19 has already guested with US superstar Drake, was awarded best contemporary song for Question Time, a seven-minute hip-hop track that criticises Theresa May over lack of NHS funding, military involvement in Syria, wage stagnation and more. The track also castigates David Cameron over Brexit (&quot;You fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing line&quot;) and ponders whether Jeremy Corbyn can be an effective, honest politician.
                One particularly heartfelt verse attacks May over her handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster.  </div>
